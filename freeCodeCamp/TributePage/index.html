                José Protacio Rizal Mercado y Alonzo Realonda was a Filipino nationalist, writer, and revolutionary. As one of the most prominent advocates for reforms during the Spanish colonial period, he inspired many Filipinos through his writings and ideas. His novels, *Noli Me Tangere* and *El Filibusterismo*, exposed the abuses of the colonial government and the Catholic Church in the Philippines.

                Rizal's martyrdom on December 30, 1896, solidified his status as a national hero. His life and works are celebrated annually on Rizal Day, a national holiday in the Philippines.
